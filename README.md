## 📦 Requirements

To use this tool, you'll need:

- Node.js version 16 or later to run the UI Dashboard (please check your Node.js version by running `node -v`)
- Python for running the scraper

**Don't have Node.js or Python? No problem!**  

You can easily run this tool within Gitpod, a cloud-based development environment. We'll cover how to set that up later.
